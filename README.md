My solutions to [Advent of code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024/) in python.

| Day number | Stars won | Brief strategy description |
| :---:         |     :---:      |          :--- |
| 01   | ‚≠ê ‚≠ê |  value sorting and list comprehension |
| 02   | ‚≠ê ‚≠ê |   |
| 03   | ‚≠ê ‚≠ê |  Regex findall() |
| 04   | ‚≠ê ‚≠ê |  Searched for "XMAS" and "SAMX" in horizontal, vertical and diagonal. For diagonal I used np.diagonal(mat, offset=i) |
| 05   | ‚≠ê ‚≠ê |  I used topological sorting in the second part. I made a Graph given the rules subsetted to the updates list (otherwise it was a cyclic graph and topological sort couldn't work) |
| 06   | ‚≠ê | |
| 07   | ‚≠ê | I had to build a binary tree recursion function that tries to divide or to subtract the right most number to the solution. This avoid to use a brute force solution of all possible combinations, since I check whether the right most number is a divisor of the solution, if it's not, I only need to use the subtraction, update the result and repeat. |
| 08   | ‚≠ê ‚≠ê | I looped for each unique type of antenna and computed the distance between them. Just simple distance operators within numpy arrays |
| 09   | ‚≠ê | |
| 10 | ‚≠ê ‚≠ê | From day 07 I learn how to properly use a binary tree recursion and I was really happy to apply it again here! In the first part, when I reached the 9, I transformed into a 10 so that I would not count it again froma nother trail. Part 2 was just removing this condintion so that I could count all the trails. |

My solutions to [Advent of code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023/) in python.

| Day number | Stars won | Brief strategy description |
| :---:         |     :---:      |          :--- |
| 01   | ‚≠ê ‚≠ê     |  - I used [word2number](https://pypi.org/project/word2number/) library to transform words to numbers <br> - In cases such as __"oneight"__ where I need to take the last one, I reversed the whole string and took the first reversed number. In other words it's like evaluating the string from right to left and looking for reversed words (from "eight" to "thgie").    |
| 02     | ‚≠ê ‚≠ê       |  Brute force I guess    |
| 03 | ‚≠ê ‚≠ê | I used __signal.convolve2d()__ function to inspect the nearest points around a gear (3x3 convolution) |
| 04 | ‚≠ê ‚≠ê | I tried with recursive function but it took too long. Then I found out the solution could be found in a "arithmetically" simpler way |
| 05 | ‚≠ê | I could not find an efficient strategy to solve this |
| 06 | | üíÉ |
| 07 | ‚≠ê ‚≠ê |  The function __np.lexsort()__ was super handy here to order a numpy array by a column first, then another one and so on. |
| 08 | ‚≠ê ‚≠ê | Least common multiplier |
| 09 |  | üíÉ |
| 10 |  | üíÉ |
| 11 |  ‚≠ê ‚≠ê | Manhattan distance. I took account of the universe expansion when computing the distance. In this way I did not filled up my computer's memory by expanding _a priori_ |
| 12 |  | üíÉ |
| 13 | ‚≠ê ‚≠ê | - Made use of __np.flip()__ function to compare similarity between a matrix and a mirrored version of the same. <br> - Horizontal reflection is just vertical reflection of the transposed matrix, so I used the same function.
| 14 | ‚≠ê | First part was ok, second part... I don't know much about cycle detection.
